# DSD-ATM-Using-VHDL

## About

The primary objective is to design an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) that allows customers to perform basic financial transactions without the need for a human teller. An authentication system must be in place in regards to cardholder verification to ensure security. VHDL will be used to program the working of the system. The main code will then be verified by running a testbench. This, in turn, will generate output waveforms for the respective code, and by checking them against the expected state flow diagram, we will be able to determine as to whether the system is working as intended. RTL synthesis will also be performed to obtain the synthesized circuit of our system.

All the programs and simulations have been run on ***Xilinx ISE Design Suite***.
